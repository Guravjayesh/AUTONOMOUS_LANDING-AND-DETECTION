# The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System


# Tensorflow Object Detection for autonomous drone landing

I had the honor of being involved in a project under the guidance of experienced Seniors. I was fortunate to join the esteemed Challengers team, where I had the opportunity to enhance my knowledge in the fields of computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning as an aspiring AIML student in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) domain.

During this project, my primary focus was on object detection, specifically aiming to detect drones using the TensorFlow framework. The ultimate objective of the project was to accurately identify and mark the drones' locations, facilitating autonomous landing procedures.



## About the project :

The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System is an AI-powered project that detects unauthorized drones and guides them to a designated landing location. 

it consists of a network of sensors and cameras installed in the targeted airspace. These sensors and cameras are equipped with  algorithm that can identify the drones and track their movements in real-time. Once a drone is detected, the system will initiate the landing process, directing the drone to a designated landing pad or a specific location based on predetermined coordinates.
Using TensorFlow, the system can accurately identify and track the drone's movements in real-time
