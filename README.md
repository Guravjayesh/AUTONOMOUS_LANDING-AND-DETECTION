# The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System


# Tensorflow Object Detection for autonomous drone landing

I had the privilege of participating in a project that was led by our 4th year seniors when I was in my 2nd year of studies. As a student in the AIML branch, a new branch at that time, I was given the opportunity to join the Challengers team due to my learning and knowledge in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning. In this project, I focused on the drone object detection component.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to Nicholas Renoutoo, whose concise tutorials on TensorFlow object detection enabled me to learn the technique and achieve the outcome.


## About the project :

The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System is an AI-powered project that detects unauthorized drones and guides them to a designated landing location. 

it consists of a network of sensors and cameras installed in the targeted airspace. These sensors and cameras are equipped with  algorithm that can identify the drones and track their movements in real-time. Once a drone is detected, the system will initiate the landing process, directing the drone to a designated landing pad or a specific location based on predetermined coordinates.
Using TensorFlow, the system can accurately identify and track the drone's movements in real-time
