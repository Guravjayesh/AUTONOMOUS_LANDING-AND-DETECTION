# The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System


# Tensorflow Object Detection for autonomous drone landing

I had the privilege of participating in a project that was led by our seniors I was given the opportunity to join Challengers team and to my learning in computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning as AIML(CSE) aspirant. In this project, I had focused on the object detection and the target was to detect the drone using tensorflow and get the markings of the drone for the autonomous landing




## About the project :

The Autonomous Drone Detection and Landing System is an AI-powered project that detects unauthorized drones and guides them to a designated landing location. 

it consists of a network of sensors and cameras installed in the targeted airspace. These sensors and cameras are equipped with  algorithm that can identify the drones and track their movements in real-time. Once a drone is detected, the system will initiate the landing process, directing the drone to a designated landing pad or a specific location based on predetermined coordinates.
Using TensorFlow, the system can accurately identify and track the drone's movements in real-time
